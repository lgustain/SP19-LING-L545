<p>While I tried several different features, including the word 3 previous to the target word, the suffix of the word 2 previous, and the first letter of the word previous, the best I could get was the precision and recall staying the same. The tagger as I currently have it (and will turn it in) has the first letter of the word before the target word as a feature, and this yields 96.22% (the original tagger was 96.34%).</p>
